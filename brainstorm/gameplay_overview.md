# Gameplay [indev]

At its base, I envision Voxel Party to be a laid back RTS/City Builder set in a procedurally generated world.

## RTS Elements

Voxel Party will mainly be set from an isometric view port, but will have a free camera mode as well. Might was well since it's using 3D OpenGL. This might, however be detrimental to performance. It's something consider, but I'm designing for some time in the future so I try not to be hindered by performance.

Combat, multiplayer, and progression are all elements that will be taken from the RTS genre. However, since these are rather time consuming features to implement, Voxel Party will begin as a city builder.

* Age of Empires

## City Builder Elements

Unlike most RTS style games which focus on combat, I'd like Voxel Party to focus on resource gathering and technological progression. Not necessarily grinding, but there's something awesome about building supply chains and machines to automate resource gathering.

* Sim City

## Minecraft Inspirations

Minecraft is one of my favorite games. I would say my favorite, but I've got a lot of nostalgia for the older versions of Age of Empires and Battlefield.

### World

What I love about Minecraft is the world and atmosphere. I've already experimented with some terrain generation in Voxel Party, and I *love* it. Unlike most high-budget RTS games, I don't have a full team of level designers. I would much rather generate beautiful, infinite worlds than make them by hand.

### Voxels

Voxel Party is also made of voxels, just like Minecraft. Minecraft certainly isn't the first game to use voxels, but it's the first mainstream game to (that I can think of). With voxels, it's possible to make something resembling a world, but they're imprecise enough to distance the game from reality. There isn't that pressure to make photo realistic worlds when you use voxels, simply because you *can't*. They also makes engine development, building, and fully destructible worlds much easier.

### Machines

There are several mods that add very powerful machines to Minecraft. They excavate quarries, process minerals, generate power, and perform all sorts of other tasks. They're just awesome. And, it would be much more awesome in an RTS style game.
