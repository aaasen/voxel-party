# Voxel Party

Voxel Party is an 3D voxel-based MVC game engine built on Java, LWJGL and OpenGL.

Voxel Party is in its infancy. Check the [issues page](https://github.com/aaasen/nexus/issues)
to request new features and bug fixes, or to see those in progress.
The [milestones page](https://github.com/aaasen/nexus/issues/milestones) contains larger goals for the project.

# Notes

This is a rather old indev release. Many features do not exist in this version, or have not been implented at all. Flying around should work though.

# Installation

## Download
Download the repository using Git or as a zip, and import it into your IDE.
For Eclipse, create a new Java project. After that just go to the left sidebar, right click and go to *Import > File System*.
Then, select the Nexus directory and import it.

## Set up LWJGL

This step is detailed in the [LWJGL Wiki](http://www.lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) ([for Eclipse](http://www.lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Setting_Up_LWJGL_with_Eclipse))

## Note About Updates

IDEs like Eclipse will generally make a copy of the code to work on.
You should be able to copy-paste the original `nexus/.git` directory into `your_workspace/nexus/src/`
